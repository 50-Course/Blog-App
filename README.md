### This is a simple backend project done in django to understand the concept and usage of CRUD operations.

### Hold Up! Why Carnage?? Oh hey! that's my gaming name.. i nknow its lame but man, gotta stick with it -__-

### Emphasis isn't on the frontend so don't be pissed of if you didn't find that elegant look, it's the on the backend - User Authentication System, CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete) on the database (Blog's Posts).

### Hey! One more thing? Okay, it's lame, just sit back and enjoy the ride :)
